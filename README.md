# 🎲 Scorecard App

A real-time shared scorecard application for games like Yahtzee, Scrabble, and generic tally games. Create rooms, share codes with friends, and track scores together!

## Features

- **Multi-Game Support**: Yahtzee, Scrabble, and Generic Tally games
- **Room-Based System**: Create rooms with unique 8-character codes
- **Real-Time Updates**: See scores update as players add them
- **Player Management**: Join rooms with custom player names
- **Score History**: Track scores by rounds with optional notes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Direct Cell Editing**: Click directly on scorecard cells to enter scores (Yahtzee)
- **Game Setup Flow**: Add all players before starting the game (Yahtzee)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter to save, Escape to cancel cell editing
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-disruptive error and success messages
- **Per-Player Editing**: Joined players can only edit their own column; their header shows a `(You)` badge
- **Light / Dark Theme**: Floating toggle that persists across visits and otherwise follows the OS preference

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Django 4.2.7**: Python web framework
- **Django REST Framework**: API development
- **SQLite**: Database (can be easily changed to PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **CORS Headers**: Cross-origin resource sharing

### Frontend

- **React 18**: Modern JavaScript framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Router 6**: Client-side routing
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API calls
- **lucide-react**: Inline SVG icons that inherit the active theme
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Modern responsive layout

> The browser only ever talks to the frontend. In development the CRA dev server proxies `/api`, `/admin`, and `/static` to Django on port 8000 (see `frontend/src/setupProxy.js`), so requests stay same-origin and CORS never enters the browser path.

### Testing

- **pytest / pytest-django**: Python testing framework with coverage
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: JavaScript testing
- **Cypress**: End-to-end flow testing
